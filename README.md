RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on the principles of reduced instruction set computing (RISC). It is designed to be simple, efficient, and extensible, making it suitable for a wide range of computing systems, from embedded devices to supercomputers.

TASK1:  Task is to install required tools for this internship such as ubantu on VMBox,Openlane,RISCV toolchain and perform simple example by taking simple C code and converting it into Assembly level code.

1.Install ubuntu on Oracle Virtual Machine Box

2.Install Openlane

OpenLane is an open-source flow for digital ASIC design, specifically developed to assist in the creation of integrated circuits (ICs) using open-source tools. It provides a complete automated RTL-to-GDSII (Register Transfer Level to GDSII) design flow, integrating multiple open-source tools and frameworks to facilitate chip design.

Follow the below instructions in terminal
